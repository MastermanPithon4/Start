Goals for today:
 - Turning on the Pi
 - Opening the Terminal
 - Download some Python
 - Open the development enviornment



Download some Pyton

Create a place for the code
1. Create a folder by entering 'mkdir code' (you can type 'ls' to see the folder you created)
2. Enter the 'code' folder by entering 'cd code'

Case MaTtErS

Download the code into the 'code' directory
1. Enter â€˜git clone https://github.com/MastermanPithon4/Start'
2. Wait until complete
3. See what you just downloaded by entering 'ls'.  You should see a folder 'Start'
4. cd into the 'Start' folder and see what's inside by typing 'ls'

Run some Python
1. Enter 'idle HelloPiThon.py &'
2. Run by clicking the 'Run' menu then 'Run Module'

Terminal cheat sheet:
cd [DirectoryPath]    - change directory to location specified in path
cd ..                 - go to the parent directory of the current directory
ls                    - list contents of current directory
mkdir [DirectoryName] - Make directory with name 'DirectoryName'

idle [pythonFile] &   - Open a python file in idle (the '&' allows you to continue to use the terminal while idle is open)

git clone [URL To Repo] - Download a git repository into the current directory
git status              - Status of the current git repository (must be run from within repo directory)
git add .               - Add all new files to git repository
git commit -a           - Commit all uncommitted changes as a 'ChangeSet'
                          (Will open terminal text editor, you must enter a commit message then save. 
                          control-x, then Y, then enter to close and save file)
git push                - Push all local change sets to git repo (will need github account and write access to repo)
git pull                - Pull all changes to repo from server into your local copy of the repo
